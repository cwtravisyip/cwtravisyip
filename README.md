### Hi there üëã

‚ò∫Ô∏è I'm Travis, a data scientist working to optimise airline operation and provide data solutions that enable data-driven decision-making. 
As a recent Geographic Data Science graduate, I have experience handling geospatial data and cloud computing for big data analysis.
I also developed extensive programmes to collect data through connections to public AIPs and weeb scraping.

üå± While coding in Python that is executed in Jupyter Notebook has been the primary method I use to conduct my analyses, I am now focusing on writing more structured, programmatic code to improve collaboration and code reusability.

üî≠ I'm currently working on the exploration of the shipping activities in the Danish Water [Automatic Identification System data](https://www.dma.dk/safety-at-sea/navigational-information/ais-data) ([repository](https://github.com/cwtravisyip/danish_ship_traffic_eda)). I am also picking up the skill to implement programmes through cloud computing on GCP in addition to other ad hoc analysis I conduct mainly on the operation of airports.
