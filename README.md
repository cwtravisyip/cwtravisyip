### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Travis, a data scientist working to optimise airline operation and provide data solutions that enable data-driven decision-making. 
As a recent Geographic Data Science graduate, I have experience handling geospatial data and cloud computing for big data analysis

While coding in Python that is executed in Jupyter Notebook has been the primary method I use to conduct my analyses, I am now focusing on writing more structured, programmatic code to improve collaboration and code reusability.
